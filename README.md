## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, BERT, and similar architectures are highly versatile but often require fine-tuning to align with specific tasks or datasets. This repository provides an example-driven approach to fine-tuning LLMs using state-of-the-art techniques, including:

- Dataset preparation and preprocessing.
- Transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models.
- Domain-specific customization.
- Evaluation and performance benchmarking.

## Features
- Hands-on implementation of fine-tuning techniques.
- Integration with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Scripts for dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Configurable hyperparameters for experimentation.
- Detailed documentation and examples for ease of use.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to clone the repository and get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varnika-3004/FineTuning-Using-LLM.git
   cd FineTuning-Using-LLM
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

3. Explore the dataset folder and ensure your datasets are in the required format.

4. Run the fine-tuning scripts and monitor training performance.

## Requirements
The following dependencies are required to run this project:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- Transformers (Hugging Face library)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualization)

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.
   - Ensure the dataset follows the required format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

2. Configure training parameters in `config.py` or the script.

3. Run the fine-tuning script:
   ```bash
   python fine_tune.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Results
The fine-tuned model performance is evaluated on specific metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Performance results are visualized and stored in the `results/` folder for analysis.
